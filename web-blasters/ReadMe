1. First the user will visit out api page porovided by the template google.html
2. Then as per selection being done on this page by user, by clicking the submit button it will redirect to the homepage
3.Then the registration form will be filled by the user, after which when the popup named "Thank you" comes it will make sure the data has been saved successfully in our database.
