Description:
	We chose the Track a bed track.
	The basic idea for the challenge is that we are using Google cloud Places API to look for nearest hospitals around the user.
	These hospitals appear as markers on the maps Flutter application.
	It is necessary for a hospital to first be affiliated with the app, i.e, they need to register to the service using their unique login details that are provided to them.
	This is done to make sure that the search results include hospitals that actually have COVID care available instead of just putting all the hospitals out there.
	This will also ensure easy database entry, i.e., we can easily enter the available bed information as well as other facilities.
	To differentiate between markers we are using three colors: red, blue and green.
	A marker is red when a hospital isn't registered but is still in the vicinity,
		a marker is yellow when the hospital doesn't have beds and facilities available and
		a marker is green if it has beds and facilities.
		
The contents of project directory:
	The project directory is present in the Spirit folder under the name, incubate_bed.
	This application is made using Flutter framework.
	lib folder contains the main project files.
		In lib, we have the main file and pages directory.
			Now, from the main file, we use the HomepageUser file to navigate between Home, Maps and Profile.
			Variables folder contains variables for HomepageUser.
			MapsMain contains MainMapBody.
			HomeBody contains MainHomeBody.
			AuthenticationHandler containes AuthenticationClass, Edit Screen, ProfilePage, RegistrationDetails, Signin and Signup files.
